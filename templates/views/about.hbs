                        <div class="text"><p>Alpha Healthcare is one of India's foremost  healthcare providers catering to both Indian and international patients. We are a part of the  Medical Group , a leader in the areas of  healthcare. With a group of 27 hospitals spread in 15 cities, we are the second largest hospital chain in India. To manage such a large network of hospitals, we have different entities that ensure proper functioning, smooth operations and overall patient satisfaction.</p>
            </div>
                      <div class="text"><p>At Alpha Health, we are convinced that 'quality' and 'lowest cost' are not mutually exclusive when it comes to healthcare delivery. In fact, we are well on our way to demonstrate that we are not running our institution as just another number-only business, but are attractively placed to create an affordable, globally-benchmarked quality-driven healthcare services model.</p>
          <div class="text"><p>We at Alpha Health, will continue to trust what has worked for us in the past. We will keep our model predominantly asset-light; we will reinvest our accruals; we will engage with governments for land and help them achieve affordable healthcare promises made to their constituencies; we will rent premises from private owners and create small-to-large clinics within existing hospitals. As a result of this flexible approach, we will commission hospitals, medical facilities, and clinics across the breadth of this country, getting closer to patients and taking the promise of quality affordable healthcare to the doorstep of the country's millions.</p>
